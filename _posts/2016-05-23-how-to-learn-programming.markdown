Don't forget to have fun. How many times have you read that phrase in
articles and books on learning new skills? Often it's tacked on at the
end, almost as an afterthought - a cheery signoff before you're left
to your own devices.

I'm going to turn that on its head, so I'm putting it first, front and
center. Don't forget to have fun while you learn programming - your
success depends on it. You can forget everything else in this article
but if you remember to try to have fun while learning programming,
you'll be fine.

Why is it so important to have fun? If you're not having fun, it means
you're forcing yourself to do it, which uses up willpower. This is
usually fine in the beginning - you struggle, you get frustrated, but
you grit your teeth and get on with it.

However, eventually your willpower reserves run dry. And what happens
next?  You quit. What's worse, quitting usually isn't a conscious
decision - if it was, it would be much easier to catch yourself in the
act and reevaluate what you're doing. Instead, it's almost as if your
subconscious starts conspiring against you. It starts whispering,
"Wow, you've really been hard at work on this programming thing! You
deserve a break - how about we watch some Netflix tonight?"

Eventually you start programming less and less until you've stopped
completely, and before you even realize it it's been a week since you
wrote your last piece of code.

Forget worrying about starting with the wrong language, using the
wrong tools or the other million things you can fret about as
a beginner - the biggest threat to your future as a programmer is
forgetting to have fun.

With that settled, the remains of this guide will simply be a guide
intended to make your journey into programming as pleasant as
possible, a guided tour if you will. If you want to imagine me as
a guy in bermuda shorts with a funny accent you are free to do so.

Learn A Programming Language
============================

The first stop on your tour in the land of programming is picking
a programming language.

I've seen a lot of beginners get stuck at this point - which language
is easiest? Which one is most likely to get me a job? Which one do
"real" programmers use?

The truth is that it doesn't matter much which language you learn
first - once you've learned to program in one language, you can
transfer your skills to another language at a fraction of the effort.

Think of it like driving a car - if you learned to drive automatic
it's not hard to learn driving stick. It’s different, sure, but it’s
still driving.

The one advice I would give is to think about *what* motivated you to
learn programming in the first place:

If you wanted to learn programming to build web applications
JavaScript is a natural choice. For programming microcontrollers
you'll want to learn C. If money truly is the only thing that makes
you happy and you don't mind maintaining centuries-old banking systems
then I would recommend learning COBOL. Do a bit of research, find
whichever language seems appropriate for what you want to do and pick
that one.

If you have nothing else in mind I would recommend starting with
Python, for these reasons:

 * It's flexible - it can be used to for games, web development,
   artificial intelligence... Whatever you want to build you can
   probably do it in Python.

 * It's designed with simplicity in mind, so it has a smooth learning
   curve.

 * It's popular - Python has a large and relatively friendly community
   which you can turn to in case you get stuck.

Learn Python the Hard Way is a very popular resource.

Focus
=====

As with picking a programming language, many beginners get stuck
trying to learn a lot of different things alongside programming - text
editors, version control, algorithms and data structures, etc.

My advice would be to ignore those for now and focus on learning your
first programming language. Programming is complex enough as it is, so
don't take on any more complexity if you don't have to - there's
plenty of time to learn those other things later.

As for text editors, it doesn't matter much which one you pick - as
long as it's not Notepad.

If you're using C# or Java you'll probably want to use an IDE like
Visual Studio or IntelliJ. Sublime Text is a good default choice for
dynamic languages like JavaScript, Python and Ruby.

Again, don't get caught up trying to learn every last feature of your
text editor - that will come soon enough.

Practice Makes Perfect
======================

Although programming might seem like a very theoretical exercise, it
is by and large a craft. And as with any craft, mastery requires
extensive practice.

A common complaint I've heard from people who've just finished an
online course is that they know a lot about programming, but still
don't know how to actually sit down and write a program.

<!--
It's sort of like learning to play the piano: Even if you know all the
music theory in the world, when you actually sit down at the keys
you'll be completely lost if you've never touched a piano before.
Remembering how to do something is not the same as knowing how to do
it.
-->

To retain what you learn, and to be able to tap into that knowledge
later, you need to put it into practice. Whenever you come across
a new concept, write a small exercise program to teach yourself how it
works.

Think of it like going to the gym - books, tutorials and courses are
like a personal trainer telling you how to do the exercises, but
you're not going to get stronger unless you start lifting weights.

Remembering how to do something is not the same as knowing how to do
it.

Similarly, if you find some example code, don't just copy and paste it
- type it into your editor by hand. This will improve your retention
  of the material.

Work on personal projects. Again, focus on what you think would be
fun. Don't worry too much about "building a portfolio", making money
or building a marketable skillset. A fun project is much more likely
to get finished, and a finished project is worth a lot more than
a dozen unfinished ones.

One of the best things you can do to prepare yourself for "real world"
programming is to work on a big project together with other
like-minded people. If you don't know anyone in real life, try to find
them online. With tools like GitHub, Slack and Trello, online
collaboration is easier than ever before.

Spoiler alert: Your project is very likely to fail. However, you will
still win because you've gained invaluable experience that you could
have gotten no other way. Also, in contrast with end-users, potential
employers might still be impressed by a half-finished project.

Making Friends With Failure
===========================

Learning programming will make you fail in ever so spectacular ways:
There's some code that won't compile, some bug you can't wrap your
head around, or some concept that just won't click. You will get
angry, raise your shaking fists to the skies and curse the name of
Alan Turing for ever inventing these blasted computing machines. "Man
was not meant for this!", you'll cry out into the night as your
program crashes for the fiftieth time. In short, you will be
frustrated.

Fear of failure can manifest itself in many, insidious ways. At times
you will feel tempted to drop what you're currently doing and try out
some new tutorials, learn another programming language or pick up
a few more books from Amazon. Don't do it. This is your subconscious
trying to save your ego from taking another bruising. After all, how
can you fail at reading a book?  However, constantly jumping between
things to learn will not help you make progress.

Don't fall into the trap of studying as a way to put off practice.

Studying as Procrastination
===========================

Learn just

This is alright. In fact, this is a good thing. 

If you're not feeling frustrated occasionally

If you never feel frustrated you’re not learning fast enough. Failure is a prerequisite for learning. Don’t be worried if you feel frustrated - do worry if you think it’s all smooth sailing.

Remember, the only way to fail is to quit.

Bear this in mind: Failure is a prerequisite for success.

How to Solve Problems Like Julius Caesar
========================================

In his campaign against the Gallic tribes, Julius Caesar faced a formidable
opponent. United, the tribes constituted a military force of strength equal or
greater than that of the roman legions. However, by exploiting the internal
divisions between the Gauls, Caesar ensured that he only had to fight them one
tribe at a time. By the time they  had united under Vercingetorix, it was
already too late and the Gauls were forced to surrender. Just like Julius
Caesar defeated the Gallic tribes by dividing them up and tackling them one at
a time, you can also use the strategy of "divide and conquer" to tackle
seemingly impossible problems.

Let's say you want to write a Tic-tac-toe game for two players. What features
does it need? For one, players need to be able to input their next move. If
you're not sure how to do that, figure out how to write a program that just
accepts player input. You also need a way to display the game board. If you're
not sure how to do that, write a program that just draws a board with noughts
and crosses. Next, you need to keep track of the state of the game, and so on.

Eventually you will know everything you need to know create Tic-tac-toe - all
that's left is to put the pieces together. This is still not a trivial
exercise, but it's far easier when you know what the pieces looks like.

This strategy has many applications: If there's an error in your program that
you can't figure out, break it out into individual pieces and test if they work
as expected. If you need to learn a complex skill, try to break it down into
smaller skills that you can learn piece by piece. Divide and conquer.

Ask Questions
=============

Eventually, you'll run into a problem you just can't seem to solve. This is a
good time to ask for help.

Your first step should be to attempt a Google search for your problem. I've
heard some beginners think of this as cheating, but let me tell you a secret:
Professional programmers Google all the time, we just don't like to talk about
it.

If Google doesn't give you the answer, you can always post your question a
forum such as Stack Overflow or the /r/learnprogramming sub-reddit. Some things
you should think about before posting a question:

Make sure to search the forum to check if someone has already asked the same
question. Read the FAQ if there is one.  Describe your problem in detail; can
someone who's never seen it before understand or reproduce your problem?
Provide code examples if applicable; you can use a service like Pastebin or
Github Gists to publish code.  In short, read the rules and be respectful of
people's time and you'll get the answers you need.

If you have to look something up, write it down! If it wasn't obvious
the first time, chances are you'll have to look it up again soon.

The Joy of Programming
======================

Above all, remember this: Programming is supposed to be fun!
