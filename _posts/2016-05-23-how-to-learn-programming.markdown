One of the most common questions I hear from beginner programmers is where to start. Should you read a book, take an online class or go to university? Which language should you start with? What???

Follow the instructions in this guide and I guarantee that you'll be able to program for a living by the end of it. Bear in mind that each step might take several months or even years (Peter Norvig link) - you might want to bookmark this page. However, don't let that discourage you. You can learn the basics within a few hours. And if you start now, you're minutes away from creating your first program.

That might sound like a bold claim, but there's nothing special about this guide; it's just a description of the path most programmers take, without dead ends and distractions???

Learn A Programming Language

The first step when learning programming is to learn a programming language. Many beginners stress out about what language to learn first. Don’t. Once you’ve learned to program in one language, you can learn a second one at a fraction of the effort, so which one you start with doesn't matter much. It’s sort of like driving a car; if you learned to drive automatic you can learn to drive stick. It’s different, but it’s still driving.

That said, some languages are more suitable for beginners than others. I would recommend starting with Python, a powerful general-purpose language used by Google, NASA and Reddit, to name a few. Why Python? First of all, it's designed with simplicity in mind, which makes it suitable for beginners. Second, it's very flexible - you can use Python to make web pages, video games, scientific computing and much more. Third, Python is very popular, which means there's a large community to turn to in case you get stuck.

Learn Python the Hard Way is a very popular resource.

Practice Makes Perfect

Although programming is a very theoretical subject, actually sitting down to write a program requires quite a bit of "muscle memory". It's sort of like learning to play the piano: Even if you know all the music theory in the world, when you actually sit down at the keys you'll be completely lost if you've never touched a piano before. Remembering is not the same as knowing.

To retain what you learn, and to be able to tap into that knowledge later, you need to put it into practice. Whenever you come across a new concept, write a small exercise program to teach yourself how it works. Similarly, if you find some example code, don't just copy and paste it - write it by hand. This will improve your retention of the material.

If you're studying away from a computer, say on your commute, I would even advise you to carry a pen and notebook to write programs in. Your fellow passengers will either think you're crazy, a genius, or possibly both. It won't matter though - you will be too busy coding to notice.

If you have to look something up, write it down! If it wasn't obvious the first time, chances are you'll have to look it up again soon.

Focus

(first 20 hours again)

There's so many things you can learn as a software developer; version control, text editors, Unix tools... I advise you to ignore those for the time being and focus on learning your first programming language.

Get a decent text editor; you don't want to be stuck coding in Notepad. As with language, which one you start with doesn't matter that much, but make sure it supports syntax highlighting at least. Sublime Text is a good default choice.

Making Friends With Failure

Learning programming will make you fail in ever so spectacular ways: There's some code that won't compile, some bug you can't wrap your head around, or some concept that just won't click. You will get angry, raise your shaking fists to the skies and curse the name of Alan Turing for ever inventing these blasted computing machines. "Man was not meant for this!", you'll cry out into the night as your program crashes for the fiftieth time. In short, you will be frustrated.

Fear of failure can manifest itself in many, insidious ways. At times you will feel tempted to drop what you're currently doing and try out some new tutorials, learn another programming language or pick up a few more books from Amazon. Don't do it. This is your subconscious trying to save your ego from taking another bruising. After all, how can you fail at reading a book? However, constantly jumping between things to learn will not help you make progress.

"Studying as a way to procrastinate on practice"

Practice, practice, practice. Write as much code as you can. "Read just enough to be able to self-adjust” (First 20 hours). Don’t get distracted!

 

 
Studying as Procrastination

It might seem tempting to buy another book, watch another tutorial or attempt to learn a new language. Don’t do it. This is your fear of failure talking. (see above) After all, reading books is easy - you can’t fail, and it feels like you’re making progress. But if you’re reading instead of doing, you’re just procrastinating. Your wheels are spinning but you have no traction.

Learn just

This is alright. In fact, this is a good thing. 

If you're not feeling frustrated occasionally

If you never feel frustrated you’re not learning fast enough. Failure is a prerequisite for learning. Don’t be worried if you feel frustrated - do worry if you think it’s all smooth sailing.

Remember, the only way to fail is to quit.

Bear this in mind: Failure is a prerequisite for success. 

I love this quote, which is probably a mangled version of something Chuck Jones once said:

Everyone can draw a great picture; they just have to draw a lot of bad ones first.
I love this quote because it illustrates perfectly the mindset you need to adapt. Learning is the objective, not creating perfect programs.

How to Solve Problems Like Julius Caesar

In his campaign against the Gallic tribes, Julius Caesar faced a formidable opponent. United, the tribes constituted a military force of strength equal or greater than that of the roman legions. However, by exploiting the internal divisions between the Gauls, Caesar ensured that he only had to fight them one tribe at a time. By the time they  had united under Vercingetorix, it was already too late and the Gauls were forced to surrender. Just like Julius Caesar defeated the Gallic tribes by dividing them up and tackling them one at a time, you can also use the strategy of "divide and conquer" to tackle seemingly impossible problems.

Let's say you want to write a Tic-tac-toe game for two players. What features does it need? For one, players need to be able to input their next move. If you're not sure how to do that, figure out how to write a program that just accepts player input. You also need a way to display the game board. If you're not sure how to do that, write a program that just draws a board with noughts and crosses. Next, you need to keep track of the state of the game, and so on.

Eventually you will know everything you need to know create Tic-tac-toe - all that's left is to put the pieces together. This is still not a trivial exercise, but it's far easier when you know what the pieces looks like.

This strategy has many applications: If there's an error in your program that you can't figure out, break it out into individual pieces and test if they work as expected. If you need to learn a complex skill, try to break it down into smaller skills that you can learn piece by piece. Divide and conquer.

Where To Ask For Help

Eventually, you'll run into a problem you just can't seem to solve. This is a good time to ask for help.

Your first step should be to attempt a Google search for your problem. I've heard some beginners think of this as cheating, but let me tell you a secret: Professional programmers Google all the time, we just don't like to talk about it.

If Google doesn't give you the answer, you can always post your question a forum such as Stack Overflow or the /r/learnprogramming sub-reddit. Some things you should think about before posting a question:

Make sure to search the forum to check if someone has already asked the same question. Read the FAQ if there is one.
Describe your problem in detail; can someone who's never seen it before understand or reproduce your problem?
Provide code examples if applicable; you can use a service like Pastebin or Github Gists to publish code.
In short, read the rules and be respectful of people's time and you'll get the answers you need.

The Joy of Programming

Above all, remember this: Programming is supposed to be fun!
